## How OBADA Works

### "How OBADA Powers Transparency and Trust"

Our open, decentralized system allows ITAD and electronics industry partners to document every step of an asset’s lifecycle, from deinstallation to reuse, using ISO 20435-compliant Digital Product Passports.

### 3-Step Visual Process

1. **Create a Digital Product Passport:**  
   Capture key details about each asset, including location, condition, and ownership. Data is securely stored, creating a unique DPP for each item.

2. **Enable Transparent Tracking:**  
   Our blockchain-backed system provides real-time tracking and verification of each asset’s journey. DPPs are easily updated with new locations, transfers, and photos, ensuring full transparency.

3. **Support Global Compliance and Sustainability Goals:**  
   OBADA aligns with proposed ISO 20435 standards, giving regulatory authorities and partners a trusted framework to verify responsible reuse and reduce waste across the electronics industry.
