## An Industry Coalition

<div class="block block-text-image">
    <h3 class="block-text-image__image image-title">Built for ITAD<br><span>IT Asset Disposition</span></h3>
    <p class="block-text-image__text">Founded in 2017, OBADA is a coalition of ITAD industry stakeholders representing over 100 organizations focused on end-of-life electronics. The OBADA DAO governs the development of the ITAD Blockchain, a decentralized registry that securely links physical assets to their digital records using tokenization. The OBADA Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, collaborates with ISO to develop an open standard for cryptographic proof of proper data destruction and responsible recycling, ensuring interoperability and sustainability across global supply chains.</p>

### LEGAL
* There is no offer for investment here. OBADA DAO membership is not an investment.
* A decentralzied ledger keeping track of "system credits" is necessary to coordinate the activity and system functions between nodes operated by the DAO members.  While this ledger could be described in terms of a utility token, at this time there are no plans to offer any native token to the general public nor on any public token exchange.
