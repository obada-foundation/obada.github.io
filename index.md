# Introducing the pNFT Standard
**Representing physical assets as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).**

[The OBADA Foundation](https://www.obadafoundation.org/about) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit working with ISO ([ISO TC/307 AHG3](https://www.iso.org/committee/6266604.html) to develop an open standard for creating digital representations of real-world assets. 

The [The OBADA DAO](https://forum.obada.io/) (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a coalition of stakeholders in the IT asset disposition (ITAD) {building a decentralized registry](https://github.com/obada-foundation/) to store pNFTs, based on the [pNFT Standard](https://www.obada.io/standard/). 

The registry creates a public utility where the pNFT becomes a fundamental, interoperable component of supply chain systems and layer 1 blockchains, Anyone can use pNFTs to maintain chain-of-custody over the complete lifecycle of any device, from manufacturer to the recycler.

## The <span>OBADA</span> Standard
The OBADA Foundation is steward of the OBADA standard. We have been working with ISO since 2019 to develop it as an international standard.
The standard consists of an open data methods for representing an immutable physical asset identifier as a cryptographic addresses, a data method for creating a cryptographic checksum of all associated asset data, and an open protocol for transferring and resolving the data. [read more](https://www.obada.io/standard/)...


<p><br></p>


## The <span>OBADA</span> Platform
<div class="block">
    <p>The OBADA DAO was formed to create a platform, a Physical NFT Registry, that implements the standard. The platform is based on open W3C DID (decentralized identifier) methods. We previously worked on proof of concepts based on Hyperledger and Ethereum. Current development is based on Cosmos, using the Tendermint consensus algorithm.</p>

## FUTURE:  Platform Economics: Rewards for Recycling

		<p>IN the current implementation, "gas" for basic transactions is paid with a native utility token.  Collected gas fees are distributed back to the nodeholders to compensate them for their compute power.  There is no middleman.</p>
	</div>
    <div class="block">
        <img src="/assets/svg/reward.svg" class="block__image" alt="" width="80" height="80">
		<p>In the future, the same utility token is used to "order traceability". The mechanism is by "staking" the NFT. The stake, plus a reward, is returned upon proof of recycling.</p>
		<p>There is expected to be a high loss rate of staked tokens, due to the nature of recycling, as the real-world assets are lost from the chain. These tokens will be replaced by the newly issued tokens that are created with proof of recycling.</p>
		<p>This unique cryptoeconomic mechanism, where the total token supply is not maintained by cryptographic methods, but rather by the real-world actions, creates a world-changing incentive structure for proper recycling.</p>

### LEGAL
* There is no offer for investment here. OBADA is not an investment.
* At this time there are no plans to offer the native utility token to the general public or on any public token exchange.   
* At this time, OBADA is a permissioned industry-led project targetted at the asset disposition sector.
* As of May 2022, the OBADA DAO has 23 members.  We will be opening up additional 77 seats (for a total of 100) later this year.  For those interested in joining the waitlist please contact us at bizops @ obada.io.
