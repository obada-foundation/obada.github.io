## The OBADA DAO: A Decentralized Autonomous Organization run by an ITAD Industry Coalition

The OBADA DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a coalition of stakeholders from the IT asset disposition (ITAD) industry.

## The Product:  A Decentralized Registry to Store these "Carfaxes" of Physical Assets
The OBADA DAO is creating a public utility to allow anyone to create a "Carfaxâ„¢" for their physical assets.  
This will allow enterprise and supply chain systems to track the service history of any asset, from manufacturer the recycler. and it creates a simple, standard interface for the world to order and track asset disposition services such as data destruction and responsible recycling.

This decentralized "Carfax" is a digital representation of physical asset, a type of non-fungible token (NFT) called a physical NFT (pNFT).  The DAO is creating a decentralized registry to store these pNFTs.

* [Blockchain Explorer](http://explorer.alpha.obada.io)

## Based on an Open Standard for Representing Physical Assets as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).
This decentralized registry is being built according to [an open standard](https://www.obada.io/standard/) being developed
 by [the OBADA Foundation](https://www.obadafoundation.org/about), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, and the International Standards Organization [ISO TC/307 AHG3](https://www.iso.org/committee/6266604.html) as a standard called "Representing physical assets using non-fungible tokens (NFTs)."
 
## Why ITADs and other companies in the sector join the DAO
The DAO is limited to 100 Seats, for companies in the IT Asset Disposition Sector Only.  There is a one time membership fee of $5000 which is being used to fund development of the blockchain and operations of the foundation.
Besides a seat at the table in the future of our industry, the main benefits of joining the DAO are governance rights, operational rights, and economic rights.

## The <span>OBADA</span> Standard
The OBADA Foundation is steward of the OBADA standard. We have been working with ISO since 2019 to develop it as an international standard.
The standard consists of an open data methods for representing an immutable physical asset identifier as a cryptographic addresses, a data method for creating a cryptographic checksum of all associated asset data, and an open protocol for transferring and resolving the data. [read more](https://www.obada.io/standard/)...


<p><br></p>


## The <span>OBADA</span> Platform
<div class="block">
    <p>The OBADA DAO was formed to create a platform, a Physical NFT Registry, that implements the standard. The platform is based on open W3C DID (decentralized identifier) methods. We previously worked on proof of concepts based on Hyperledger and Ethereum. Current development is based on Cosmos, using the Tendermint consensus algorithm.</p>

## FUTURE:  Platform Economics: Rewards for Recycling

		<p>IN the current implementation, "gas" for basic transactions is paid with a native utility token.  Collected gas fees are distributed back to the nodeholders to compensate them for their compute power.  There is no middleman.</p>
	</div>
    <div class="block">
        <img src="/assets/svg/reward.svg" class="block__image" alt="" width="80" height="80">
		<p>In the future, the same utility token is used to "order traceability". The mechanism is by "staking" the NFT. The stake, plus a reward, is returned upon proof of recycling.</p>
		<p>There is expected to be a high loss rate of staked tokens, due to the nature of recycling, as the real-world assets are lost from the chain. These tokens will be replaced by the newly issued tokens that are created with proof of recycling.</p>
		<p>This unique cryptoeconomic mechanism, where the total token supply is not maintained by cryptographic methods, but rather by the real-world actions, creates a world-changing incentive structure for proper recycling.</p>

### LEGAL
* There is no offer for investment here. OBADA DAO membership is not an investment.
* A decentralzied ledger keeping track of "system credits" is necessary to coordinate the activity and system functions between nodes operated by the DAO members.  While this ledger could be described in terms of a utility token, at this time there are no plans to offer any native token to the general public nor on any public token exchange.
